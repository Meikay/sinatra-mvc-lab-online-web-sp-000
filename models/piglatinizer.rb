  def piglatinize(input)
    # Your app will take in a string from a user through a form, convert it to pig latin,
    # and return the string to the user.

    #if first letter in word starts with a consonant move first letter of word to the end and
    # add 'ay' at the end of the word

    #if the first letter in the word starts with a consonant cluster, move consonant cluster of word to the end and
    # add 'ay' at the end of the word

    #For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" or "yay" to the end (or just "ay") ||
    # An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s)
    # along with the first consonant or consonant cluster.
